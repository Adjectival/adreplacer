"I spend hours building websites in order to stay current with frontend tech. It's literally a side hustle verging on full time gig. In order to reflect my hard work, I considered installing adspace on my portfolio projects, but this seemed a little too mercenary. So I briefly borrow some of your device CPU when you browse my portfolio instead. Ads suck! We need less visual real estate slathered in advertising, not more.
No mining happens anywhere but in your browser while you're perusing some of my demo projects. A pop up always notifies you of this policy, and leads to this document. Mining stops when the browser tab is closed, or when the tab is not the current app. No software is downloaded to your device, it's a nifty in browser process. No personal data nor identifiable information is touched, let alone saved. Thanks for your understanding. Contact me for more info if you feel curious or concerned.
